### **Lesson Plan for Military Order of the Purple Heart Website**

#### **Overview and Goals**

* **Goal** : Understand the structure and functionality of the website, including Firebase setup, React component organization, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
* **Outcome** : The developer will be able to navigate the codebase, modify components, add new features, and work with Firebase and GitHub effectively.

---

### **1. Project Setup and Initialization**

#### **Lesson 1: Cloning the Repository and Setting Up Environment**

* **Objective** : Clone the GitHub repository, install dependencies, and set up environment variables for Firebase.
* **Steps** :

  1. **Clone the Repo** :

  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd <project-directory>
  ```

  1. **Install Dependencies** :

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

  1. **Setup `.env` File** :
     * Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
       ```plaintext
       VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
       VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
       VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
       VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
       VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
       VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
       ```
  2. **Start the Development Server** :

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  1. **Verify** : Ensure the app loads correctly by checking the console and inspecting Firebase Authentication.

### **2. Code Structure and Component Breakdown**

#### **Lesson 2: Understanding the Project Structure**

* **Objective** : Familiarize with key files, React components, and Tailwind CSS styling.
* **Key Files and Folders** :
  * `public/index.html`: Root HTML file.
  * `src/firebase.js`: Firebase configuration.
  * `src/App.jsx`: Main application file and route setup.
  * `src/components/Navbar.jsx`: Navigation bar with login/logout and conditional links.
  * `src/pages/`: Each page component (Home, About, Programs, Store, etc.) is organized here.

#### **Lesson 3: Component Walkthrough**

* **Objective** : Review how each component works, focusing on the `SignUp` and `ProtectedRoute` components.
* **Key Components** :
  * **`Navbar.jsx`** :
    * Includes conditional rendering for logged-in users, admin links, and logout functionality.
  * **`SignUp.jsx`** :
    * Handles user sign-up with Firebase Authentication.
    * Redirects the user to the Member Area upon successful sign-up.
  * **`ProtectedRoute.jsx`** :
    * Wraps routes that require authentication and specific roles (e.g., admin access).
* **Task** : Review and explain any conditional rendering or role-based logic.

### **3. Firebase Integration**

#### **Lesson 4: Firebase Setup and Configuration**

* **Objective** : Understand Firebase integration for authentication and database.
* **Steps** :
  1. **Firebase Setup in Firebase Console** :
     * Show how Firebase Authentication and Firestore are enabled.
  2. **firebase.js File** :
     * Explain the Firebase initialization, including `getAuth` for authentication and `getFirestore` for database access.
  3. **Usage in Components** :
     * Walk through how `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`, `signInWithEmailAndPassword`, and `signOut` are used in `SignUp.jsx` and `Navbar.jsx`.

---

### **4. Styling with Tailwind CSS**

#### **Lesson 5: Tailwind CSS Basics and Customization**

* **Objective** : Learn how Tailwind CSS is used for consistent styling across the app.
* **Steps** :
  * Review `index.css` for Tailwind CSS imports.
  * Go over custom colors in `tailwind.config.js` for purple, gold, black, and white.
  * Show Tailwind classes in components like `Navbar.jsx` and `SignUp.jsx`.

---

### **5. GitHub Workflow for Collaboration**

#### **Lesson 6: GitHub Workflow and Version Control**

* **Objective** : Use GitHub effectively for collaboration, version control, and code reviews.
* **Steps** :

  1. **Branching Strategy** :
     * **Main Branch** : Reserved for stable code.
     * **Feature Branches** : Each new feature or bug fix should be on a separate branch.
  2. **Creating a New Branch** :

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```

  1. **Making and Committing Changes** :
     * Make changes in the code, then stage and commit them:
       ```bash
       git add .
       git commit -m "Add feature description"
       ```
  2. **Pushing Changes to GitHub** :

  ```bash
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```

  1. **Creating a Pull Request** :
     * On GitHub, create a pull request for the feature branch to merge into the main branch.
  2. **Code Review and Merge** :
     * Explain how to review code changes, request reviews, and merge approved pull requests.

---

### **6. Testing and Deployment**

#### **Lesson 7: Testing and Firebase Deployment**

* **Objective** : Test the application locally, set up Firebase Hosting, and deploy the app.
* **Steps** :
  1. **Test Locally** :
     * Review functionality by running the app and testing features (sign-up, login, role-based access).
  2. **Firebase Hosting Setup** :
     * **Initialize Firebase Hosting** (run in project root):
       ```bash
       firebase init hosting
       ```
     * Follow prompts to set up Firebase Hosting.
  3. **Deploy to Firebase** :

  ```bash
  npm run build
  firebase deploy
  ```

---

### **Summary and Final Review**

* **Objective** : Recap key lessons and provide next steps for further development.
* **Steps** :
  * Review the GitHub workflow for new features or bug fixes.
  * Discuss testing processes and best practices for Firebase.
  * Encourage documenting changes and collaborating on GitHub for team cohesion.
